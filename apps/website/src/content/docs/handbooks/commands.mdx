title: Commands reference
---

Hacksmith provides a powerful CLI to help you manage integration blueprints, configure preferences, and automate onboarding workflows. This reference covers all available commands and their options.

## Interactive Mode

Run `hacksmith` without any arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
hacksmith
```

In interactive mode, you can use slash commands like `/plan` and `/preferences` with the same options described below.

## Global Options

All commands support these global options:

- `--version` - Display the version number
- `--help` - Display help information

---

## `plan` Command

The `plan` command loads, validates, and executes integration blueprints. Blueprints define product-specific setup flows, code generation, and integration steps.

### Usage

```bash
hacksmith plan [options]
```

### Options

| Option               | Alias | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--blueprint <path>` | `-b`  | Path to blueprint TOML file (local path or HTTP URL) |
| `--github <repo>`    | `-g`  | GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format             |
| `--execute`          | `-e`  | Execute blueprint flows interactively                |
| `--json`             | `-j`  | Output blueprint as JSON                             |
| `--dev`              | `-d`  | Enable development mode for flow execution           |
| `--help`             | `-h`  | Show help for the plan command                       |

### Examples

**Load a local blueprint:**

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./path/to/blueprint.toml
```

**Load and execute a blueprint:**

```bash
hacksmith plan -b ./blueprint.toml --execute
```

**Load blueprint from URL:**

```bash
hacksmith plan -b https://example.com/blueprint.toml
```

**List blueprints from GitHub repository:**

```bash
hacksmith plan --github saif-shines/hacksmith-blueprints
```

**Output blueprint as JSON:**

```bash
hacksmith plan -b ./blueprint.toml --json
```

**Interactive mode:**

```bash
# Start hacksmith and use slash command
hacksmith
> /plan --blueprint ./blueprint.toml
> /plan -b ./blueprint.toml --execute
```

### What Happens During Execution

When you use the `--execute` flag, Hacksmith will:

1. **Load and validate** the blueprint
2. **Execute flows** interactively, guiding you through each step:
   - Browser actions (opening URLs, waiting for user confirmation)
   - Input prompts (gathering configuration, secrets, etc.)
   - API calls (verifying integrations)
   - File operations (generating config files, code templates)
3. **Generate a mission brief** with contextifacts (execution summary, tech stack, integration details)
4. **Offer to launch AI agent** (if configured) or copy the mission brief to clipboard

### Dev Mode

Use `--dev` or `-d` to enable development mode during execution:

```bash
hacksmith plan -b ./blueprint.toml --execute --dev
```

Dev mode provides additional debugging information and verbose output during flow execution.

## `preferences` Command

The `preferences` command manages Hacksmith configuration, including AI agent setup and tech stack scanning.

### Usage

```bash
hacksmith preferences [subcommand]
```

### Aliases

- `prefs`

### Subcommands

#### `setup`

Interactive setup wizard for configuring AI agent and tech stack.

```bash
hacksmith preferences setup
```

**What it does:**

1. **AI Agent Configuration:**
   - Scans for installed AI CLIs (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
   - Lets you choose which AI agent to use
   - Supports "Manual mode" for copy-to-clipboard workflow with VS Code Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

2. **Tech Stack Scanning:**
   - Analyzes your project structure and dependencies
   - Detects languages, frameworks, package managers, databases, and more
   - Saves tech stack to preferences for use in mission briefs

**Example:**

```bash
hacksmith preferences setup
```

#### `show`

Display current preferences including configured AI agent and saved tech stack.

```bash
hacksmith preferences show
```

**Output includes:**

- AI agent provider and CLI path
- AI agent version and last update time
- Tech stack summary (languages, frameworks, etc.)
- Tech stack scan time and project path

**Example:**

```bash
hacksmith preferences show
```

#### `scan`

Scan and save your project's tech stack to preferences.

```bash
hacksmith preferences scan
```

**What it detects:**

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, etc.
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Vue, Astro, Express, FastAPI, etc.
- **Package Managers:** npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, pip, cargo, etc.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- **Tools:** Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, etc.

**Example:**

```bash
hacksmith preferences scan
```

#### `brief`

Generate a mission brief for your AI agent without executing a blueprint.

```bash
hacksmith preferences brief
```

**What it does:**

1. Prompts for an optional integration goal
2. Generates a mission brief with tech stack context
3. Saves the brief to `~/.hacksmith/mission-brief.md`
4. Offers to copy the brief to clipboard

**Example:**

```bash
hacksmith preferences brief
```

You'll be prompted:

```
What is your integration goal? (optional, press Enter to skip)
> Integrate payment processing with Stripe
```

#### `reset`

Reset all preferences (AI agent configuration and tech stack).

```bash
hacksmith preferences reset
```

**Confirmation required.** This will clear all saved preferences.

**Example:**

```bash
hacksmith preferences reset
```

## AI Agent Integration

Hacksmith integrates with AI CLIs to automate the next steps after executing a blueprint.

### Supported AI Agents

- **Claude Code** - https://claude.com/claude-code
- **GitHub Copilot** - Install via `gh extension install copilot`
- **Manual mode** - Copy mission brief to clipboard for use with VS Code Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, or any AI assistant

### How It Works

1. Run `hacksmith preferences setup` to configure your AI agent
2. Execute a blueprint with `hacksmith plan -b blueprint.toml --execute`
3. After successful execution, Hacksmith generates a mission brief
4. Choose to:
   - **Launch AI agent automatically** (if CLI is configured)
   - **Copy to clipboard** (for manual mode)
   - **Skip** and access the brief later at `~/.hacksmith/mission-brief.md`

### Mission Brief Format

The mission brief is a structured markdown file containing:

- **Blueprint name and ID**
- **Executed flows summary**
- **Tech stack details** (languages, frameworks, dependencies)
- **Integration goal** (if provided)
- **Next steps** (guided by blueprint's agent prompt template)
