import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

At the moment, the product is not even launched. Since we do not expect a lot of traffic coming our way, the contents in ths page are going to change drastically.

#### Development mode

##### Setup

<Steps>
1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:saif-shines/hacksmith.git
   ```
2. We decided to use `pnpm`. No good reason. Install dependencies.
   ```sh
    # Install and build everything
    pnpm install && pnpm build:all

    # Install only (what you asked for)
    pnpm install

    # Install with specific workspace filtering (if needed)
    pnpm install --filter hacksmith
    pnpm install --filter @hacksmith/website # we use astro starlight

    ````

3.  You see this is a mono repo. There's both website and cli projects both present.

    ````sh # CLI development
    pnpm cli:dev -- plan --blueprint foo # equivalent to hacksmith -- plan --blueprint foo

        # Website development
        pnpm site:dev

        # Build everything
        pnpm build:all
        ```
    ````

4.  To add any npm package you will need this --filter flag to be passed

    ```sh
    # Add to both projects individually
    pnpm --filter hacksmith add <package-name>
    pnpm --filter @hacksmith/website add <package-name>

    # Or add as dev dependencies
    pnpm --filter hacksmith add -D <package-name>
    pnpm --filter @hacksmith/website add -D <package-name>

    # Add to all workspaces
    pnpm -r add <package-name>

    # Add as dev dependencies to all
    pnpm -r add -D <package-name>
    ```

  </Steps>
