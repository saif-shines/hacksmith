title: Try Hacksmith

import { Button, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

We want to open source hacksmith. But the work is still in progress to keep the pipeline cleaned up.

Until then you can:

- Author blueprints to onboard and implement for your users
- Use hacksmith to speed up your own onboarding and implementation

## Installing hacksmith

<Steps>
  1. Install Nodejs. (Coming soon: directly install binaries) 2. Run the following command: ```sh
  npm i hacksmith ``` See the package on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hacksmith)
</Steps>

## Run hacksmith directly
