We want to open source hacksmith. But the work is still in progress to keep the pipeline cleaned up.

Until then you can:

- Author blueprints to onboard and implement for your users
- Use hacksmith to speed up your own onboarding and implementation

## Installing hacksmith

<Steps>
  1. Install Nodejs. (Coming soon: directly install binaries) 2. Run the following command: ```sh
  npm i hacksmith ``` See the package on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hacksmith)
</Steps>

## Quick Start

After installation, set up Hacksmith for your project:

<Steps>
  1. **Navigate to your project directory** ```sh cd your-project ``` 2. **Set up preferences (AI
  assistant and tech stack)** ```sh hacksmith preferences setup ``` This will: - Scan for AI CLIs
  (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) - Analyze your project's tech stack - Save everything to your
  project's `.hacksmith/` folder 3. **Check your session status** ```sh hacksmith session status ```
  4. **Run your first blueprint** ```sh hacksmith plan --blueprint ./example.toml --execute ``` If
  interrupted, just run the same command again - Hacksmith will offer to resume!
</Steps>

## Run hacksmith directly
