import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Hacksmith shines wherever repeatable, multi-step engineering work exists. Common scenarios:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Payments Integration" icon="credit-card">
    Generate and validate a complete Stripe setup across stacks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Hire Onboarding" icon="person-add">
    Standardize dev environment, access, and repos in minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Dev Environments" icon="gear">
    Provision tools, SDKs, and configs consistently for every project.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auth & SSO" icon="lock">
    Implement secure auth flows (Auth0, Firebase, custom) tailored to your stack.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
