Blueprints are TOML files that define guided workflows. Packs are curated sets of blueprints for a product.

## Schema overview

A minimal blueprint:

```toml
schema_version = "0.1.0"
smith = "your-org/hacksmith-blueprints"

[overview]
enabled = true
Title = "Onboard to Your Product"
description = "Set up and integrate Your Product"

[variables.api_key]
description = "API key from dashboard"
required = true
sensitive = true

[slugs]
base_url = "https://app.yourproduct.com"

[[flows]]
id = "your-product"
title = "Onboard to Your Product"
```

## Sections

- Metadata: `schema_version`, `smith`
- Overview: optional intro shown before flows
- Variables: values to capture (mark secrets with `sensitive = true`)
- Context: docs/links for AI agents
- Slugs: URL templates for navigation
- Agent: AI prompt template
- Flows: step-by-step interactive experience

## Packs

A pack is a GitHub repo containing one or more blueprint files and docs, e.g. `your-org/hacksmith-blueprints`. The CLI supports GitHub shorthand for discovery:

```bash
hacksmith plan --github your-org/hacksmith-blueprints
# or shorthand
hacksmith your-org/hacksmith-blueprints
```

If a repo contains multiple blueprints, Hacksmith will list them and prompt you to choose.

## Validation

Blueprints are validated on load. Invalid combinations (e.g., both `--blueprint` and `--github`) or missing values are surfaced with actionable errors. Use predictable identifiers and add regex validation for formats specific to your product.

## Environment

Hacksmith respects:

- `DEBUG=1` for verbose errors
- `NO_COLOR` to disable colors

Use project-local `.hacksmith/` for captured variables and session state, and `~/.hacksmith/` for system-level preferences.
