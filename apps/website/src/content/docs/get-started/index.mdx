Hacksmith is a command-line tool that helps engineering teams onboard new team members and implement new products or services into existing projects. **Engineers switch between study and work modes in seconds.**

## How Hacksmith works

Hacksmith uses guided workflows called "blueprints" to automate complex setup and integration tasks. Here's the process:

```d2
direction: right

Users -> Terminal: "npx hacksmith"
Terminal -> Hacksmith
Blueprint Authors -> Blueprints: "Publish"
Blueprints -> Hacksmith: "Reads and executes"
Hacksmith -> "Successfully guided": Users
```

**Users** run commands like `hacksmith plan --blueprint ./my-blueprint.toml` to start guided workflows that handle complex onboarding and implementation tasks.

**Blueprint authors** create these workflows that guide users through processes like setting up accounts, getting credentials, and integrating services into projects.

## Common use cases

### Integrate payment processing

A developer needs to add Stripe payments to their product. They run:

```bash
npx hacksmith /path/to/integrate-stripe.toml
```

The tool guides them through:

- Creating a Stripe account
- Logging into the dashboard
- Getting API credentials
- Setting up payment integration

### Onboard new team members

A new engineer joins the team. They run:

```bash
npx hacksmith your-repo/onboarding.toml
```

The tool helps them get access to:

- Development tools and services
- Team documentation
- Code repositories
- Communication platforms

## Key benefits

- **Reduces context switching** between learning and implementing
- **Standardizes complex workflows** across team members
- **Automates repetitive setup tasks** like credential management
- **Provides guided assistance** for both new and existing integrations
