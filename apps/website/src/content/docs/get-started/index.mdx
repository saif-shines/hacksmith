From browsing to building. One command.

**Hacksmith** accelerates engineering team productivity by automating complex setup and integration tasks through guided workflows called **blueprints**. Teams reduce onboarding time by up to 80% and standardize implementation processes across projects. Engineers switch between learning and building modes in seconds, eliminating context switching overhead.

## Introduction

**Hacksmith** helps engineering teams onboard new members and implement services faster. Teams use **blueprints**—structured workflow definitions—to guide users through complex multi-step processes like setting up payment systems or configuring development environments.

Hacksmith eliminates the friction between learning how to implement features and actually building them. Teams maintain consistency across implementations while reducing the cognitive load of context switching.

## Core Concepts

**Blueprints** define guided workflows that automate multi-step engineering tasks. Each blueprint contains a sequence of steps that can include user prompts, automated commands, and validation checks.

**Workflows** execute these blueprints interactively, adapting based on user input and system state. Users provide responses to prompts while the tool handles the repetitive, error-prone parts of implementation.

**Templates** within blueprints allow customization for different environments, projects, or user preferences. Teams create reusable blueprint templates that adapt to specific use cases.

## Installation and Setup

Install Hacksmith globally to access it from any project directory.

```bash
npm install -g hacksmith
```

Verify the installation works correctly.

```bash
hacksmith --version
```

Hacksmith requires Node.js version 16 or later. The tool works on macOS, Linux, and Windows systems with standard terminal environments.

## Basic Usage

Start Hacksmith with a blueprint file to begin a guided workflow.

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./path/to/blueprint.toml
```

List available blueprints in the current directory.

```bash
hacksmith list
```

Get help for any command or option.

```bash
hacksmith --help
```

## Use Cases

### Integrate Payment Processing

Add Stripe payments to a product by following guided setup steps.

**Blueprint authors** create workflows that handle account creation, credential management, and integration setup automatically.

**Users** run the blueprint and follow prompts for project-specific configuration:

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./stripe-integration.toml
```

The workflow guides users through each step while handling the complex parts automatically.

### Onboard New Team Members

Set up new engineers with development tools, documentation access, and project context.

**Teams** create onboarding blueprints that standardize the setup process across all new hires.

**New engineers** run the blueprint to get immediate access to:

- Development tools and services
- Team documentation and processes
- Code repositories and permissions
- Communication platforms and channels

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./team-onboarding.toml
```

### Set Up Development Environments

Configure local development environments with consistent tooling and dependencies.

**DevOps teams** maintain environment blueprints that ensure all developers use identical setups.

**Developers** run the blueprint to get a fully configured development environment:

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./dev-environment.toml
```

### Implement Authentication Systems

Add user authentication and authorization to applications using providers like Auth0 or Firebase.

**Security teams** create authentication blueprints that enforce security best practices.

**Developers** follow guided workflows that implement proper authentication flows:

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./auth-implementation.toml
```

## Architecture Overview

Hacksmith operates through a three-layer architecture that separates concerns and enables flexibility.

**Command Layer** handles user input and output, providing a consistent CLI experience across platforms.

**Engine Layer** processes blueprint definitions, evaluates conditions, and executes workflow steps.

**Service Layer** manages external integrations, file operations, and system interactions.

```
User Input → Command Layer → Engine Layer → Service Layer → System Output
```

Blueprints define the workflow logic in TOML format, specifying steps, conditions, and templates. The engine interprets these definitions at runtime, adapting execution based on user responses and system state.

## Best Practices

### Blueprint Design

Structure blueprints with clear, single-purpose steps. Group related actions into logical phases that users can understand and follow.

Write step descriptions that explain both what happens and why it matters. Users make better decisions when they understand the context of each action.

Include validation checks at critical points to catch errors early. Users appreciate workflows that fail fast with clear error messages.

### Team Adoption

Start with high-impact, repetitive processes like onboarding or common integrations. Teams see immediate value and become advocates for broader adoption.

Establish blueprint ownership within teams. Domain experts maintain the blueprints for their areas, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

Review blueprints regularly to incorporate feedback and improve user experience. Successful blueprints evolve based on real usage patterns.

### Security Considerations

Never store sensitive credentials in blueprint files. Use environment variables or secure prompts for API keys and passwords.

Implement proper error handling for external service failures. Users need clear guidance when integrations fail due to network issues or service outages.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

**Problem:** `hacksmith: command not found` after installation.

**Solution:** Restart your terminal or source your shell profile. The PATH update requires a new shell session.

**Problem:** Permission errors during global installation.

**Solution:** Use a Node version manager like nvm, or install with `sudo npm install -g hacksmith` (not recommended for security).

### Blueprint Execution Problems

**Problem:** Blueprint fails with "template not found" errors.

**Solution:** Verify the blueprint file path and ensure all referenced templates exist in the blueprint directory.

**Problem:** Interactive prompts don't appear in non-interactive environments.

**Solution:** Use the `--non-interactive` flag with environment variables for CI/CD environments:

```bash
hacksmith plan --blueprint ./blueprint.toml --non-interactive
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Blueprints run slowly with large codebases.

**Solution:** Use the `--parallel` flag when steps can run independently, and ensure your system meets the minimum requirements.

## Glossary

**Blueprint**: A TOML file that defines a complete workflow with steps, conditions, and templates for automating engineering tasks.

**Template**: Reusable configuration blocks within blueprints that customize behavior based on user input or environment variables.

**Workflow**: The runtime execution of a blueprint, handling user interactions and step execution.

**Step**: An individual action within a blueprint, such as running a command, prompting for input, or validating a condition.

**Engine**: The core processing component that interprets blueprints and manages workflow execution.

## Next Steps

Explore the blueprint format specification to create custom workflows for your team.

Check the CLI reference for advanced usage patterns and configuration options.

Review example blueprints in the project repository to understand common patterns and best practices.

Start with a simple use case that your team repeats frequently, then expand to more complex workflows as you gain experience.
